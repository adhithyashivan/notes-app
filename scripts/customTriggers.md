Below are few custom triggers.

The general approach for implementing these with Azure Functions and Power Automate (on a free tier or Developer Plan) would be:

1.  **Data Storage/Access:**
    *   For true "triggering" based on data changes, you'd ideally have these CSVs in a system that Power Automate can easily monitor or that can send webhooks. For free/dev tiers, options include:
        *   **SharePoint Lists:** Upload CSVs to SharePoint lists. Power Automate has excellent triggers for SharePoint item creation/modification. This is often the easiest path.
        *   **Azure Blob Storage:** Store CSVs here. Azure Functions can be triggered by new blobs or use a timer trigger to periodically check for changes (more complex to detect precise changes in a CSV file without reading and comparing).
        *   **Azure Table Storage (or Cosmos DB free tier):** More structured NoSQL storage. Azure Functions can easily interact with these.
    *   For simplicity in this exercise, let's assume the data is accessible and the "trigger" is an Azure Function that either:
        *   **Is called by Power Automate on a schedule** (e.g., every 5 minutes) to check for conditions.
        *   **Receives a webhook** (if JIRA/Confluence could be configured to send one to the Function's HTTP endpoint upon certain events â€“ this is more advanced and often requires paid tiers of those source systems).

2.  **Azure Function Logic (Python):**
    *   The function would fetch the relevant data (e.g., from SharePoint via Power Automate, or directly if stored in Azure).
    *   It would then apply the specific logic for the use case (e.g., check if a CR status changed to "Closed").
    *   If the condition is met, it would return data to Power Automate.

3.  **Power Automate Flow:**
    *   **Trigger:** Scheduled, or an HTTP request trigger (if the Azure Function calls Power Automate back, or if it's directly triggered by a webhook).
    *   **Action:** Call the Azure Function to perform the check / get data.
    *   **Condition:** Based on the Azure Function's response, check if the trigger condition was met.
    *   **Action:** Send an email, post a Teams message, create a task, etc.

Let's dive into the use cases. I'll categorize them for clarity.

---

This list should give you a very solid base. Each of these would involve:
*   Defining the precise condition in your Azure Function (Python code to read/filter your CSV data or data from SharePoint).
*   Designing the Power Automate flow to trigger the function, evaluate its response, and take the specified action (email, Teams message, etc.).

Remember that accessing and efficiently querying CSVs for these kinds of stateful triggers can be less performant than using a proper database or SharePoint lists. For a production system, migrating this data to a more trigger-friendly source would be recommended. But for learning and development, this is a great way to understand the mechanics!
